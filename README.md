# Weather Map

This is my first Flutter projectâ€”a simple **Weather Map** app built with the help of my friend **Muflih**.

## Overview
Weather Map shows real-time weather details for any location on an interactive map.  
Users can **search for a place** or **tap directly on the map** to see the current temperature, weather condition, and a marker at that spot.

## Features
- Interactive map powered by **flutter_map**.
- Search bar to find any location quickly.
- Tap anywhere on the map to get real-time weather and temperature.
- Marker highlights the selected location.

## Tech Stack
- **Flutter** (Dart)
- **flutter_map** and **latlong2** for mapping
- **HTTP package** for API requests
- **OpenWeather API** for live weather data
- **OpenStreetMap / MapTiler** for map tiles

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/indrajith-mv/weathermap.git
